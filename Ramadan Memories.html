<h2>Ramadan 2021 is here!</h2>

<p>Here is a picture I cherish and a link of the Ramadan Calendar for all to view.</p>

<p> Ramadan is the holy month where Muslims fast. It is for 30 days, and we fast from sun up to sundown</p>
<p>Here are some of the reasons why we fast</p>
<ol>
    <li>Ramadan is a month where fasting allows you to take the time to appreciate what you have</li>
    <li>In this holy month you are reminded that there are many in this world who are hungry and go hungry everyday</li>
    <li>Muslims also fast to seek repentanance and take this time to self-reflect</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the 30 days are complete we celebrate what is known as Eid! Here are some of the things that we do to get ready for Eid!</p>
<ul>
    <li>We go shopping for new clothes</li>
    <li> The women put on henna the night before</li>
    <li> We clean up the house the night before Eid</li>
    <li> We buy sweets and make breakfast to break our fast with on the morning of Eid!</li>
</ul>
